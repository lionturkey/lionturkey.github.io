# Sweet Beginnings at Recurse

One week at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) means I've got lots of dreams and little concrete progress. But lots of dreams comes with lots of fun!

## Inspiration from others:
- Woody's sound-based [pong game](https://woodburyshortridge.github.io/sonified-pong)
- Blogging recommendations from Edith (Iron Blogging group): "Focus on what you blog, not where you blog. You can always just put it in a GitHub Gist." (paraphrased)
- Music recommendations from [Music Consumption Group](https://mcg.recurse.com/sessions/128)
- Bug Driven Development/Art talk from from Rachel, [mold-inspired art](https://editor.p5js.org/moishe/sketches/tYuJpHUGy) from Moishe
- Witnessed my first Rust plus WebAssembly [site](https://r4chel.github.io/art/), also from Rachel. Mind BLOWN

## Related Dreams:
- Make sounds using PureData or whatever
- Write blog blobs like this one or worse
- Make some computer generated art!
- Remake a [very broken](https://github.com/lionturkey/lionturkey.github.io) voice recorder webapp from last year... maybe in Rust? Is that unreasonable?
- AND put all of the above on an okay-looking personal website to show to the world! (my best friend is my world :heart:)

## Unrelated Dreams:
- Make a Korean grammar parser
- Make a Korean Webtoon -> text scanner

## Tiny things I've done so far:
- Learned about [Hangul unicode normalization](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42478455/convert-hangul-jamo-to-hangul-syllables-in-javascript) and [unicode normalization](https://withblue.ink/2019/03/11/why-you-need-to-normalize-unicode-strings.html) in general (thanks Scott for the second link)
- Made my first moving circles [in p5js](https://editor.p5js.org/lionturkey/sketches/eiRUTapyU)
- Made my first boops in PureData and nearly blew out my speakers

## Something I'm thinking about:
Time spent planning is an investment. I should "do less" and think more in order to be more effective in what I do. Let's see if I can be better about this in the upcoming week.

## Goals this week:
- Publish a personal website that I can show off to my best friend and my new recurse friends :)
- Turn a picture into music (even if it's just one note)... and share it with MY NEW RECURSE FRIENDS
- Make something stupid with Rust and WebAssembly and figure out how to put it on my website... **AND SHARE IT WITH MY NEW RECURSE FRIENDS**
- Begin my transformation from mostly human to [Ankified monster](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)... and keep that to myself... maybe...
